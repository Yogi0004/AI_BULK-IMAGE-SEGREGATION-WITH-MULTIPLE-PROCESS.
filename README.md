**Version:** 2.0 – Professional Edition  
**Application Type:** Enterprise Streamlit Dashboard  
**Processing Mode:** Unlimited Bulk Image Processing  
**Statistics:** Persistent (All-time tracking)

---

## 1. Overview

The **Homes247 Premium Real Estate Image Processing Dashboard** is an enterprise-level AI application designed to **process, classify, analyze, and organize large volumes of real-estate images** with **no limitations on quantity or file size**.

The system integrates **AI-based image classification**, **advanced image quality analysis**, **automatic resizing**, **analytics dashboards**, and **exportable reports**, all delivered through a **modern, professional Streamlit interface**.

This solution is optimized for **high-volume production environments** commonly found in real-estate platforms and digital property portals.

---

## 2. Core Capabilities

### 2.1 Unlimited Bulk Processing
- No limit on number of images per session
- No file size restrictions (KB to GB+)
- Designed for thousands of images in a single run

### 2.2 AI-Driven Image Classification
Images are automatically classified using a trained AI model into:
- Floor Plan Images
- Master Plan Images
- Gallery Images
- Rejected Images (low confidence)

Classification acceptance is controlled via a **confidence threshold** configurable from the UI.

---

### 2.3 Image Quality Assessment
Each image undergoes a comprehensive quality evaluation based on:
- Sharpness
- Brightness
- Contrast
- Blur detection
- Edge density

A **final weighted quality score** determines whether an image is marked as:
- **Good Quality**
- **Bad Quality**

---

### 2.4 Automatic Image Resizing

| Category     | Output Resolution |
|-------------|------------------|
| Floor Plan  | 1500 × 1500       |
| Master Plan | 1640 × 860        |
| Gallery     | 820 × 430         |
| Rejected    | Original size     |

High-quality resizing is performed using **Lanczos resampling** while preserving aspect ratio.

---

### 2.5 Persistent Statistics Tracking
All processing statistics are stored persistently in a JSON file and maintained across sessions.

Tracked metrics include:
- Total images processed (all time)
- Category-wise counts
- Quality-wise counts
- Number of processing sessions
- First and last upload timestamps

Statistics can be reset manually from the sidebar.

---

### 2.6 Analytics & Visualization
The dashboard provides:
- Category distribution charts
- Quality distribution pie charts
- Confidence score histograms
- Average quality per category
- Real-time processing progress indicators

All visualizations are rendered using **Plotly** with a dark professional theme.

---

### 2.7 Reporting & Downloads
Users can export results in multiple formats:
- CSV Report
- JSON Report
- Excel Report (Results + Summary)
- Complete ZIP Archive containing:
  - Processed images
  - Reports
  - Auto-generated summary README
